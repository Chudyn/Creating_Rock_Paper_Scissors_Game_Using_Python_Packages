The aim is to create the popular game : Rock, Papers and Scissors using Python. Here, I made use of the python module named "random". This version of game is controlled by me, the Player and Computer. 
If there is a winner, it will print "You win!" but if there is a tie, the game restarts.
Note: 
Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock and Scissors beats Paper.
